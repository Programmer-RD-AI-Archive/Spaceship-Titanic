# SpaceShip Titanic

I am doing the SpaceShip Titanic Competition From Kaggle. I want to learn more about Data analytics and Data Cleaning and Data PreProcessing Methods Which is a really important part of ML and general AI. I am ok in it now. But I want to be better in it.
Thats my important task of this project. And also I want to experiment with different types of models and different libraries also But I am mostly going to be focused on the Data. Pls Leave Any Suggestions in the Discussion Sections or if there is an issue please leave it in the issues section. If you want to change the issue you can fork this repo and create a pull request. I will check it and do the necessary.
